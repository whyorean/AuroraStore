# Aurora Store: A Google Playstore Client

**Aurora Store** is an unofficial, FOSS client to Google's Play Store with an elegant design. Not only does Aurora Store download, update, and search for apps like the Play Store, it also empowers the user with new features.

For those concerned with privacy, **Aurora Store** does not require Google's proprietary framework (spyware?) to operate. It works perfectly fine with or without Google Play Services or [MicroG](https://microg.org/).

**Aurora Store** was originally based on Sergei Yeriomin's [Yalp store](https://github.com/yeriomin/YalpStore). **Aurora Store** v4.0 is a rewrite of version 3 in Kotlin that follows Material Design and runs on all devices running Android 4.4+. Read the roadmap page on our Wiki for more info!
