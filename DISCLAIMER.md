You hold yourself accountable if you are to use Aurora Store with your personal Google Account, which may cause your account to be blocked/blacklisted by Google.

As per Google Play's Terms Of Service §4 and §2:

#### §4 Rights and Restrictions

> **Violation of License Terms.** If you violate any of the Content restriction provisions of the Terms, materially or repeatedly violate any of the other Terms or we are investigating you for suspected misconduct then Google may, without refund to you, terminate your access to Google Play, the Content or your Google Account and your rights under this licence will immediately terminate. We will notify you with the reason for our action unless we reasonably believe that to do so would cause Google or another person legal liability, would compromise an investigation, would compromise the operation of any Google products, services or systems, would cause harm to our users or would be in breach of the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority. See Disabled Accounts in Section 2 for additional information.

>
